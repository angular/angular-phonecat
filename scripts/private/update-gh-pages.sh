# This script will update the gh-pages branch with any changes that have been made to the steps

# The tutorial step changes are computed by checking out each step into a snapshot folder and then
# overwriting the step folders in gh-pages with these new ones.
# If there are any changes they will be committed
#
# The dependency changes are computed by running "bower update" then committing any changed files
# inside the bower_components folder onto the gh-pages branch.
#
# You should review these commits and push them to origin/gh-pages if valid.
