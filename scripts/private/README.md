# Private Maintenance Scripts

This folder contains a bunch of scripts that the maintainers of the phonecat tutorial project
can use to update and modify the steps of the tutorial.

## Testing

Since each step of the tutorial is a commit, we have a script that can checkout each commit in turn
and run the unit/e2e tests for all the steps.

- **test-all.sh**: Run this script to checkout out each of the steps in the tutorial running the
  unit and e2e tests on each step.

## Demo Pages on GitHub

We use GitHub to host a live demo of each step. This is stored in the gh-pages branch of the git
repository. The folder structure of this branch is different to the main master branch. Each step is 
copied to its own folder.

- **update-gh-pages.sh**: Run this script to copy changes to the tutorial steps and bower 
  dependencies over to the gh-pages branch.

Once you have updated the local gh-pages branch you can review the changes and push to the remote
gh-pages branch on GitHub.

```
git push origin gh-pages
```

## Pushing to GitHub

Each step in the tutorial is one commit in the git repository. Each step is also identified by a git 
tag. Any changes to a step requires the commits to be rebased and retagged.

Since it is likely that rebasing and retagging the commits will cause the local git repository to
diverge from the GitHub repository, we must force a push of the master and the tags to GitHub.

- **retag.sh**: Run this script to delete all the step tags and re-apply them to the commits that
  contain the steps. This is useful if you have rebased the commits after modifying an earlier step.
- **push-to-github.sh**: Run this script to retag and force push the master branch and the tags to
  the remote GitHub repository.
